I wrote it today.

# This is an H1

a divider:

^ that was a divider.

## Headings

stuff

### More headings

**bold** *italic* ***bold italic*** ***italic bold*** `inline code`.

````js
// ``` code block
var = "wut"
````

{% highlight js %}
// highlight code block
var = "wut"
{% endhighlight %}

````sire
// ``` code block
@ thing | barNat 10
````

> quote quote
>
> quote

#### Some custom stuff:

This is our <span class="key-term">Key Term</span> style.

These are our horizontal bars (css class), which works on html-in-markdown, but you can just use a `<hr>` tag or `---` in markdown, which does the same.

<div class="horizontal-bars"></div>
