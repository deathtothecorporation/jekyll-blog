  This episode (⁠[Chase Van Etten⁠](https://x.com/harden_hardys) & ⁠[Daniel
  Keller⁠](https://x.com/DnlKlr)) chat with [Orion
  Reed](https://www.orionreed.com/)
  ([@OrionReedOne](https://x.com/OrionReedOne)), a software engineer &
  researcher focused on the intersection of computing, human-systems interfaces,
  and emancipatory politics. Orion is engineer-in-residence at
  [tldraw](https://www.tldraw.com/), researcher at [Block
  Science](https://block.science/), and contributor to the [Liberatory
  Computing](https://www.libcomp.org/) collective. His motto is “advocating
  widespread dissatisfaction with computing.”


  Highlights:


  * The need for alternative visions for computing and reasons to be dissatisfied with the current state of software.

  * Some of the ways [HCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction) research can assist in efforts to reorganize societal structures.

  * How left-leaning crypto-optimism went from being a central narrative to relatively niche over the last decade.

  * Integration domains and the need for more cross-pollination between disparate disciplines and communities.

  * The potential for new [TfT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tools_for_Thought) concepts like Spatial Canvases to push us out of our current siloed, windowed app based local maxima (Check out Orion’s [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csGNVaB83Rk) on the topic).

  * Cool developments in AI enabled malleable software like Websim.

  * The differences between ‘ephemeral’ and ‘compostable’ software.
