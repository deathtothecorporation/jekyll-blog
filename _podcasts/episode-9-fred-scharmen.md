  This week, Daniel Keller ([@dnlklr](https://x.com/dnlklr)) and Fred Scharmen
  ([@sevensixfive](https://x.com/sevensixfive)) talk about the cultural legacy
  of space colonization and its connections to contemporary movements like
  e/acc, longtermism, and network states.


  Fred is an architect, educator, and researcher whose work focuses on the history and theory of architecture and urban design in outer space. His first book, Space Settlements (Columbia University Press, 2019) is about Gerard O'Neill's work with NASA and others to design large-scale cities in space intended to house millions of people. His second book, Space Forces (Verso, 2021), is a broader history of human aspirations in space. Fred is an international speaker and has helped speculate about life in future space habitats for NASA and the Museum of the Future in Dubai. In 2015 Fred built a scale model solar system stretching for a mile and a half through downtown Baltimore. He teaches at Morgan State University.
