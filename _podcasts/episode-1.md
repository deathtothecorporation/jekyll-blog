  In our first Episode, we've assembled the entire
  [Vaporware](https://vaporware.network/) team (all four of us) to chat about
  our Chief Architect Jack Ek's talk "PLAN: Purely Functional Programming With
  Batteries Included" which he recently gave at [Lambda
  Conference](https://www.lambdaconf.us/), the site where
  [Urbit](https://urbit.org/) founder Curtis Yarvin first presented the
  technical specifications for
  Urbit/[Nock](https://developers.urbit.org/reference/nock/definition) back in
  2016.


  We discuss the differences between Urbit and [Plunder](https://git.sr.ht/~plan/plunder), what makes Vaporware a Nock heresy and what's coming next. With [Chase Van Etten](https://x.com/harden_hardys), [Vinney Cavallo](https://x.com/vinneycavallo), [Jack Ek](https://x.com/wereness) and host [Daniel Keller](https://x.com/DnlKlr).
